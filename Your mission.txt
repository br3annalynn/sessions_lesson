You're going to build a 'wall' (think of a site you know, it rhymes with... Oh, I don't know. Space cook.).

1.
    Do this first: The first thing to do is to change your authenticate function to search the database for a user and password, rather than pulling from the admin info. It should also put the user_id into the session instead of the username. xXXXXXXXXXXXX

which will require the following handlers:

1 a. GET

    1. Take the time to write a get_user_by_name function. xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    2. make a GET handler named view_user, with a url pattern:
    /user/<username>

        The handler should take the username passed to it, and look up the user's id by their name (call the function).  Use that id to look up that user's wall_posts, then send the collection of rows to a template named wall.html. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

            ALSO, make sure you cant put in a URL of a user that doesn't exist XXXXXXXXXXXX?

    
    3. make a wall template
        a. The wall template should use a {% for %} directive to loop through all the wall_post rows, and display them each in their own div, along with the author's name and the created_at time (formatted however you like). XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx

        b. The template should also check if the browser is logged in using an {% if %} directive. If so, display a form whose method is POST and action is the url for handler number two.
            It should have: 
            a textarea
            a submit button.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

        Refer to the jinja documentation for the usage of for loops and such.

1.b POST
        A POST handler named post_to_wall, with the exact same pattern as the GET handler, which will do the following things:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    1.
        It will receive the text from handler number one, extract a username from the url, and extract the user id of the currently logged-in user from the session.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    2.
        It will search the users database table to find the user id associated with the username. (See, I told you you'd do it again.)xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    3.
        It will insert a new row into the users database with the owner_id being the user_id associated with the username, and the author_id being that of the currently logged-in user.

    4.
        It will redirect back to handler number one. xxxxxxxxxxxxx

1c. REGISTER

    A handler named register (provided for you, you just need to add one thing.


        Receive the form from the register template. Extract the username from the template. You can use your get_user_by_name function to see if that user exists.

        a. If they do exist, flash an error message and redirect them to the register page.

        b. If they don't exist, create a new record for them in the database, flash a message saying their user was created, then redirect them to the login page.
